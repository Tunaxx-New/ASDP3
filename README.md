## 📦 Installation

### Using pip

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Or using conda

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate ai-project
```

---

## 🧪 Running the Project

### Step 1: Train the Model

```bash
python src/train.py --config configs/default.yaml
```

### Step 2: Evaluate

```bash
python src/evaluate.py --model-path models/model.pt
```

---

## 🧪 Testing and Linting

```bash
pytest tests/
flake8 src/
```

---

## 🐳 Run with Docker

```bash
docker build -t ai-scientific-tool .
docker run -it --rm ai-scientific-tool
```

---

## 🔁 CI/CD Pipeline

The project uses **GitHub Actions** for:
- Linting (`flake8`)
- Running tests (`pytest`)
- Docker build validation

All workflows are defined in `.github/workflows/`.

---

## 📈 Experiment Tracking

We use **MLflow** to track:
- Training runs
- Hyperparameters
- Metrics and artifacts

Start the MLflow UI:

```bash
mlflow ui
```

Then open: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

---

## 📂 Large File Support

Use **Git LFS** for managing datasets and model weights:

```bash
git lfs install
git lfs track "*.pt"
```
